<h1> Do you love the LGBT as your friends or hate them?</h1>

<p>  what inspired you ? what inspired me what had tok place back in 2016
  a lgbtq  club had been taken over by Omar mateen a mass murderer and
  domestic terrorist ,mr.mateen had killed 49 others Police had killed mr.mateen
  later that night mr. mateen died that night due to police war with mr.mateen
  A week later ten thousands  many of us came to say the last goodbyes

<p> I think that they are your friends </p>


<p> They are people like every man in women here on this earth no  one should
  act like they are better then the lgbt they are the same as the rest of
  the people in the world</p>

<p> you may not love them but  they still  will be them self no one can
  change them  god made all of us the same we all are god  kids</p>

<p>background of the LGBT most where told that gays/lesbains  where judges
    because they love the same gender or bisexual even a drag queen </p>

<h2> Quote</h2>
  <p>  God has mad all his kids as brothers and sisters we  should love each
    other  the same even if we are apart of the LGBTQ or just a different race
    whatever you  are you are still god child </p>

<h3>The love is real </h3>
<p> some celebritys  supports the lgbtq  and they are still doing what they do
    best and that is love  every one  and not hate people on this earth LOVE IS
    LOVE</p>
